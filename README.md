# DATA_204

**Course Overview**: 

*String methods -- Built in methods for strings*
- capitalize()
- upper()
- replace()
- lower()
    
*Control Flow -- Regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function*

**List(Arrays) -- Allow is tp store large amount of data in a particular format, indext based** *[Strings, Integers, Floats, Boolean]*
***
    Example of a LIST:
    thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    print(thislist)
**Dictionary (Hashmap) -- Based on {Key : Value} pairs**
***
    Example:
    thisdict = {
        "brand": "Ford",
        "model": "Mustang",
        "year": 1964
    }
    print(thisdict["brand"])
    
**For Loops -- Used to loop through an iterable object (like a list, tuple, set)**
***
    Example:
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    for x in fruits:
      print(x)
      
**While Loops -- Used to run a specific code until a certain condition is met (TRUE)**
***
    Example:
    i = 1
    while i < 6:
       print(i)
       i += 1
    else:
       print("i is no longer less than 6")**
       
**Functions -- A block of code that only runs when it is called**
***
    Example: 
    def my_function():
       print("Hello from a function")
    my_function()**
