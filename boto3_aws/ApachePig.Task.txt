TASK:
There are 4 CSVs with data from the AdventureWorks database on s3Produce Pig Scripts to do the following:

salespeople= LOAD 's3://data-eng-resources/big-data/adventureworks/salespeople.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS (BusinessEntityID:int, TerritoryID:int, SalesQuota:int, Bonus:int, CommisionPct, float, SalesYTD:float, SalesLastYear:float);
people = LOAD 's3://data-eng-resources/big-data/adventureworks/people.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS (BusinessEntityID:int, PersonType:chararray,NameStyle:int,Title:chararray, FirstName: chararray, MiddleName:chararray, LastName: chararray);
territories = LOAD 's3://data-eng-resources/big-data/adventureworks/territories.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS (TerritoryID: int, Name: chararray, CountryRegionCode: chararray, Group: chararray, SalesYTD: int);

employees = LOAD ‘s3://data-eng-resources/big-data/adventureworks/employees.csv’ USING PigStorage(',') AS (date: chararray, open: float, high: float, low: float, close: float, adjclose: float, volume: int); 

1. Output the full names of the Top 5 Salespeople

-- Joining the two tables [salespeople,people]

joined = JOIN salespeople BY BusinessEntityID, people BY BusinessEntityID;

-- TOP 5 salespeople

order_data = ORDER joined BY SalesYTD DESC;
top_5 = LIMIT order_data 5;

-- Concatinating First Name and Last Name

name_concat = FOREACH top_5 GENERATE CONCAT (FirstName, ' ', LastName);
DUMP name_concat

OUTPUT:
(Linda C Mitchell,4251368.5)
(Jae B Pak,4116871.2)
(Michael G Blythe,3763178.2)
(Jillian NULL Carson,3189418.2)
(Ranjit R Varkey Chudukatil,3121616.2)


2. Find the average salesperson's sales (year to date) per territory name. Also provide the count of salespeople per territory.

-- Joining the two table [salespeople, territories]

sales_terr = JOIN salespeople BY TerritoryID, territories BY TerritoryID;


-- Group by territory name first then average salesperson's sales

group_name = GROUP sales_terr BY Name;
avg = FOREACH group_name GENERATE group, AVG(sales_terr.salespeople::SalesYTD);
DUMP avg

-- count of salespeople per territory
big_join = JOIN sales_terr BY BusinessEntityID, people BY BusinessEntityID;   #Joining on the 3 tables to get salespeople and territory

terr_group = GROUP big_join BY Name;  # Using the big_join -- Group by territory Name 

salespeople_count= FOREACH terr_group GENERATE group, COUNT(big_join.people::FirstName); # Counting salespeople per territory

OUTPUT:
(Canada,2)
(France,1)
(Central,1)
(Germany,1)
(Australia,1)
(Northeast,1)
(Northwest,3)
(Southeast,1)
(Southwest,2)
(United Kingdom,1)


3. Output a file containing a list of all names of employees as initials and surname (e.g. "D. R. Harvey").

initials_surname = FOREACH people GENERATE SUBSTRING (FirstName,0,1), ',' , SUBSTRING (MiddleName,0,1), (LastName);
DUMP initials_surname
