But change is afoot at Downton--change far surpassing the new electric lights and telephone. A crisis of inheritance threatens to displace the resident Crawley family, in spite of the best efforts of the noble and compassionate Earl, Robert Crawley; his American heiress wife, Cora his comically implacable, opinionated mother, Violet and his beautiful, eldest daughter, Mary, intent on charting her own course. Reluctantly, the family is forced to welcome its heir apparent, the self-made and proudly modern Matthew Crawley himself none too happy about the new arrangements. As Matthew's bristly relationship with Mary begins to crackle with electricity, hope for the future of Downton's dynasty takes shape. But when petty jealousies and ambitions grow among the family and the staff, scheming and secrets--both delicious and dangerous--threaten to derail the scramble to preserve Downton Abbey. <i>Downton Abbey</i> offers a spot-on portrait of a vanishing way of life.</p></td><td>Scripted</td><td>1627415536</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/251/downton-abbey</td><td>null</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1011244), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/252))</td><td>30</td><td>null</td><td>2017-01-20</td><td>List(tt2543796, 267777, 33436)</td><td>List(Drama, Comedy, Family)</td><td>252</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/316/792450.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/316/792450.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Girl Meets World</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 78, Disney Channel)</td><td>http://disneychannel.disney.com/girl-meets-world</td><td>2014-06-27</td><td>List(7.7)</td><td>30</td><td>List(List(Friday), 18:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p><b>Girl Meets World</b> is based on ABC's hugely popular sitcom, Boy Meets World (1993).

Quintus Lentulus Batiatus becomes a lanista (manager) when he takes over his father's ludus of gladiators. He has ambitions of stepping out of his father's shadow by seeking recognition for his own name and achieving further greatness for his house. By his side stands his beautiful wife Lucretia who will help her husband achieve his ambitions, whatever the cost. Batiatus puts all his fortunes on the man who will gain him fame and glory. That would be his best gladiator, the Celt, Gannicus, a skilled warrior who wields dual swords with deadly purpose. Those who oppose Batiatus and his future champion(s) of Capua do so at their own peril.</p><p>Purchased as an undisciplined and disheveled recruit in the first episode, Crixus the Gaul endures mockery and threats of death to become the champion after Gannicus. As Batiatus fends off repeated attempts by his professional rival Tullius to obtain Gannicus, his relationships with his father Titus and friend Solonius begin to suffer the strain of his relentless ambition. Former champion, Oenomaus, reluctantly becomes Doctore, while Syrian recruits Ashur and Dagan try to prove themselves worthy of being gladiators. Veteran gladiators Barca and Gannicus note the rising star of Crixus, as the machinations of Batiatus and Lucretia end in tragedy for several members of the household. Against all of this, the city's splendid new arena nears completion and with it the opening games that will make slaves into gods. When the arena opens, Batiatus' gladiators prevail in the contest. Gannicus again proves himself to be the champion of Capua and a god of the arena.

But one night years ago, a single act of kindness changed Mick when he saved a young girl's life, making him want to be a better vampire. Now their paths cross again and Mick develops a distinctive bond with Beth Turner who has grown into a beautiful, ambitious Internet investigative reporter. Reconnecting with her unleashes feelings Mick knows he can't pursue without exposing the part of him that would make him a monster in Beth's eyes. As Mick lives between two realities, fighting his adversaries among the undead and falling in love, he discovers the mysteries and pleasures that a valuable life has to offer.</p></td><td>Scripted</td><td>1618001143</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/456/moonlight</td><td>null</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/42621), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/457))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>2011-05-23</td><td>List(tt1582459, 163531, 25703)</td><td>List(Drama, Action, Science-Fiction)</td><td>457</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/3/9164.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/3/9164.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>The Event</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 1, NBC)</td><td>null</td><td>2010-09-20</td><td>List(7.4)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Monday), 21:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Sean Walker, stumbles into a national conspiracy after his girlfriend Leila mysteriously disappears from a Caribbean cruise.

Out of this chaos emerges a new hero: Jane Vasco, a.k.a. Painkiller Jane. Once the DEA's top agent, Jane Vasco is formidable, both mentally and physically. As a child, her father nicknamed her Painkiller Jane, describing her ability to mentally push through even the most painful situations. But her strength is about to be tested. Jane is recruited by a covert government agency dedicated to containing and, if necessary, neutralizing the threat of \"Neuros\" — individuals with superhuman neurological powers. No one knows what caused the aberrations that led to their enhanced abilities, which range from from telekinesis and telepathic suggestion to induced hallucinations. During her first investigation with her new team, Jane discovers that she too possesses an odd ability: she can't be killed. Unfortunately, she can still feel pain. Her newfound powers make Jane even more determined to learn everything there is to know about Neuros. Seldom malicious, Neuros often can't control their powers. Consequently, they tend to leave a trail of death and destruction. To prevent a panic, the government has kept the discovery of Neuros a secret, assembling a covert unit to identify and contain Neuros. Operating from a secure abandoned subway platform, the core members of the unit are Andre McBride, the seasoned team leader; Connor King, a special agent regularly armed with a smart remark; Riley Jensen, an evolved computer whiz in charge of surveillance and communications; Dr. Seth Carpenter, the unit's doctor and scientist; Joe Waterman, the middle-aged caretaker of the subway; and Maureen Bowers, Jane's former DEA partner and friend, who, like Jane, was recruited after discovering top-secret information about Neuros. Painkiller Jane is based on the comic-book series of the same name created by Jimmy Palmiotti and Joe Quesada.</p></td><td>Scripted</td><td>1628001035</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/484/painkiller-jane</td><td>null</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/43829), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/485))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>2007-03-02</td><td>List(tt0801425, 79509, 8152)</td><td>List(Drama, Science-Fiction, Thriller)</td><td>485</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/3/9395.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/3/9395.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Day Break</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 3, ABC)</td><td>null</td><td>2006-11-15</td><td>List(8.2)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Wednesday), 22:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Detective Brett Hopper is having a hellacious day; the kind of day where nothing goes his way and he just cant wait to put it behind him... only he cant, because hes living the same day over and over again.</p></td><td>Scripted</td><td>1607145335</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/485/day-break</td><td>null</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/544310), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/486))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>2005-05-13</td><td>List(tt0213327, 77544, 2608)</td><td>List(Action, Science-Fiction)</td><td>486</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/3/9402.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/3/9402.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Andromeda</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 16, Syfy)</td><td>null</td><td>2000-10-02</td><td>List(7.6)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Friday), 19:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Dylan Hunt is the courageous captain of the most glorious starship in the universe, the <b>Andromeda</b> Ascendant.

Thus, Picard's crew enjoys many of the comforts they'd have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, \"replicated\" food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind.

But with the discovery of the nearby wormhole—a shortcut through space that leads directly to the uncharted Gamma quadrant—Sisko's mandate has expanded exponentially, as the region becomes the gateway to all manner of visitors, both friendly and extremely hostile.</p></td><td>Scripted</td><td>1633914781</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/493/star-trek-deep-space-nine</td><td>null</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/45004), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/494))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>2011-03-15</td><td>List(tt1307824, 94971, 22814)</td><td>List(Drama, Adventure, Science-Fiction)</td><td>494</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/91/227932.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/91/227932.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>V</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 3, ABC)</td><td>null</td><td>2009-11-03</td><td>List(7.4)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Tuesday), 21:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Simultaneously appearing over every major city in the world, the Visitors (or <b>V</b>'s) arrived offering us the wonders of their technology and promoting peace.

The distrust of the boy has little to do with the boy himself, but it's what's inside him that causes anxiety. Long before Naruto came to be, a Kyuubi (demon fox) with great fury and power waged war taking many lives. The battle ensued for a long time until a man known as the Fourth Hokage, Yondaime, the strongest ninja in Konoha, fiercely fought the Kyuubi. The fight was soon won by Yondaime as he sealed the evil demon in a human body. Thus the boy, Naruto, was born. As Naruto grows he decides to become the strongest ninja in Konoha in an effort to show everyone that he is not as they perceive him to be, but is a human being worthy of love and admiration. But the road to becoming Hokage, the title for the strongest ninja in Konoha, is a long and arduous one. It is a path filled with betrayal, pain, and loss; but with hard work, Naruto may achieve Hokage.</p></td><td>Animation</td><td>1630602733</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/495/naruto</td><td>List(null, 20, Crunchyroll)</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/594172), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/496))</td><td>30</td><td>null</td><td>2016-02-27</td><td>List(tt3904078, 288148, 44057)</td><td>List(Comedy, Children)</td><td>496</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/12/31612.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/12/31612.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>100 Things to Do Before High School</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 27, Nickelodeon)</td><td>http://www.nick.com/videos/clip/100-things-to-do-before-high-school-clip-two.html</td><td>2014-11-11</td><td>List(7.3)</td><td>30</td><td>List(List(Saturday), 21:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p><b>100 Things to Do Before High School</b> was created by Big Time Rush executive producer and creator Scott Fellows, this new show will follow three best friends as they navigate the highs and lows of middle school, with the help of a bucket list of adventures that help them overcome class cliques, terrifying bullies and clueless teachers.

With his focus on ministry and not his personal life, Bishop Jones enlists the help of his fellow preachers to create an event that will positively impact the community of Los Angeles. Meanwhile, after much turmoil, Deitrick and Dominique are now married and have a new addition to their family - but their marital bliss is short-lived when Pastor Jay accuses Deitrick of deceiving him at their wedding. Family dynamics are also rocked when Pastor Jay and Christy's relationship is put to the test as Pastor Jay struggles to forgive a family member for their past demons. Bishop McClendon is focused on the expansion of his new ministry in Atlanta, but he is challenged when he must deal with every father's fear-giving his daughter away to another man. Pastor Wayne Chaney and First Lady Myesha must balance business with personal now that she is the newly appointed Executive Pastor of their church. And while Myesha is feeling better than ever after getting healthy and shedding 40 pounds, the couple struggles with a life-altering decision about the future of their family.</p></td><td>Reality</td><td>1521530740</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/519/preachers-of-la</td><td>null</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/46968), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/520))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>2011-01-31</td><td>List(tt1235099, 83602, 19295)</td><td>List(Drama, Crime, Mystery)</td><td>520</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/4/11275.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/4/11275.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Lie to Me</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 4, FOX)</td><td>null</td><td>2009-01-21</td><td>List(8.0)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Monday), 21:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>This compelling new drama series stars Tim Roth as Dr. Cal Lightman, the world's leading deception expert who studies facial expressions and involuntary body language to discover not only if someone is lying, but why.

Also appearing this season are sisters Kathy Wakile and Rosie Pierri.</p><p>This season, Teresa looks to repair fractured relationships with her family and friends. Although her release from prison brings the Giudice family back together, the reunion is short-lived as they only have a few months before Joe begins his sentence. After growing closer to the Gorga family while Teresa was away, Melissa now fears it may all crumble and hopes she can start fresh with her sister-in-law, permanently putting the past behind them. Meanwhile, Jacqueline, whose main focus continues to be helping her autistic son, longs for the \"Lucy and Ethel\" friendship she had with Teresa and is willing to bury their history if it means a more lighthearted future. Teresa and Jacqueline's longtime friend, Dolores, is a divorced mom of two, focusing on a road toward independence as she emotionally and financially recovers from two failed relationships. Siggy, another friend of Jacqueline's, fits right in with the Jersey group with her dynamic personality and high energy, as she navigates her relationships with her children who find her overbearing at times.

What if she could fix everything, and make the 'right' choices this time? Becca finds herself thinking about her former best friend Lolly with whom she had a falling out many years ago. If only she could talk to her once again... Suddenly, after a freakish elevator ride, Becca gets the opportunity to do just that as she wakes up in New York City on the morning of her first wedding day in 1995. She's about to marry Sean, a bad-boy artist who is all wrong for her - and she knows her first move must be to reconnect with Lolly to re-live that day.

Part shantytown, part marauder's paradise, this is a place like no other on earth - and a mounting threat to international commerce. To gain control of this fearsome society, Tom Lowe, a highly skilled undercover assassin, is sent to the buccaneers' haven to take down the brilliant and charismatic Blackbeard.

Two wives discover that it often isn't when they hand over the keys to their homes and literally switch families — but not bedrooms — for two weeks on the new reality show Wife Swap, already a critically-acclaimed smash hit in its third season in the U.K.<br /><br />Wife Swap is not a competition or a contest. It is a reality show unlike any other, where the battlegrounds are the kitchens and living rooms, child-rearing is a subject of intense and heated debate, and the outcome isn't a cash prize, but a couple's opportunity to re-discover why they love each other and decided to marry in the first place.<br /><br />In the first week of the swap, the wives move in with their new family and adopt their very different lifestyle. They agree to follow a manual written by the departing wife that sets out the rules of their new household – how they parent, shop, do the house work, manage their budgets and their social life. But then, in the second week, everything changes. The new wives take charge. They introduce their own set of rules and get to run the new household their way. It's a radical shock to both families. The results are explosive, enlightening and often very funny. This is a show about the things that really matter to families across America.<br /><br />At the end of the show, the two couples meet for the first time. In a highly-charged exchange of views, both couples make a frank assessment of each other and talk about what they've learned from the experience.</p></td><td>Reality</td><td>1606950242</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/819/wife-swap</td><td>null</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/73718), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/820))</td><td>30</td><td>null</td><td>2011-12-04</td><td>List(tt1229413, 82091, 21942)</td><td>List(Drama, Comedy)</td><td>820</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/43/109608.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/43/109608.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Hung</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 8, HBO)</td><td>http://www.hbo.com/hung</td><td>2009-06-28</td><td>List(6.8)</td><td>30</td><td>List(List(Sunday), 22:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p><b>Hung</b> follows Ray Drecker, a middle-aged basketball coach and high school history teacher who figures out how to put his exceptional physical endowments to use and change his fortunes.

The livelihood of many depends on these tenuous roads, which through the years have been responsible for the deaths of dozens of men. With one hand on the wheel and one on the door at all times, always prepared for the ice to give way under the weight of their trucks, these drivers put their lives and financial security of their families on the line in an exhilarating dash for cash. This adrenaline packed series reveals the raw, gripping quest of ice road truckers.</p><p>The desolate white landscape stretches as far as the eye can see in a world where the land meets the sky at an invisible horizon, just miles from the Arctic Circle. The fascinating, yet little-known ice road trucking industry, stationed just outside of Yellowknife in Canada's Northwest Territory, is responsible for supporting the diamond mines there. Each year, the many lakes of this region completely freeze over and engineers build an ice road over them that can withstand the weight of tractor trailers, hopefully. Jackknifing, breakdowns and accidents are commonplace. Since the terrain in this region is virtually impenetrable, and there are so few paved roads, the only way for supplies to reach the mines is by traveling over the ice road. The entire industry depends on the weather and the courage of the ice road truckers, who go 48-hour stretches with no sleep and who constantly hear the cracking of the ice right beneath their wheels.</p></td><td>Reality</td><td>1625509643</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/824/ice-road-truckers</td><td>null</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/74225), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/825))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>1986-04-04</td><td>List(tt0083437, 77216, 4146)</td><td>List(Drama, Action, Crime)</td><td>825</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/6/15722.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/6/15722.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Knight Rider</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 1, NBC)</td><td>null</td><td>1982-09-26</td><td>List(7.9)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Friday), 20:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>The series follows the thrilling adventures of Michael Knight, a detective thought to be dead, who's been given a new face and identity.

Hosted by celebrity chef Curtis Stone, the newest iteration of the Emmy Award-winning franchise pits eighteen of the biggest, boldest and most talked-about personalities from past seasons against one another in high-stakes cooking challenges designed to test their passion and imagination in the kitchen. In addition to his role as host, Curtis Stone will also anchor the judges' table with Gail Simmons, while chefs Wolfgang Puck and Hugh Acheson along with other special guests will round out the judging panel throughout the series. In each episode, two chefs will face-off in three rounds of head-to-head battles testing their skill, creativity and speed. Rivalries will be intensified as \"Top Chef Duels\" ups the ante and allows the competing chefs to each pick one mini-duel based on the other's perceived weaknesses in the kitchen. The third and final challenge of each episode will decide who moves on to compete in the ultimate high-stakes season finale where 10 chefs will be confronted with split second decisions as they lay it all on the line in the greatest challenge of their careers. In the end, only one chef will earn bragging rights and win the $100,000 grand prize and a culinary adventure that will be featured in Food and Wine Magazine.</p></td><td>Reality</td><td>1620320294</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/888/top-chef-duels</td><td>null</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1444847), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/889))</td><td>54</td><td>null</td><td>2018-05-02</td><td>List(tt0959601, 79912, 15098)</td><td>List(Comedy)</td><td>889</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/147/369353.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/147/369353.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Benidorm</td><td>List(List(GB, United Kingdom, Europe/London), 35, ITV)</td><td>http://www.itv.com/benidorm</td><td>2007-02-01</td><td>List(7.1)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Wednesday), 21:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Comedy series following regular and first-time holidaymakers as they visit the Solana Resort in Benidorm.

In the past year, Kat launched a successful line of cosmetics at Sephora and had her book hit The New York Time's Best Sellers List. As her profile has risen, so has the shop's business - and the pressure to succeed.</p><p>All of this leads into a new season that finds Kat facing familiar challenges, but quickly explodes with a level of drama and action never seen before. Kat Von D, known for her no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is demeanor has made an indelible mark on the tattoo industry. Her success in a male dominated field is inspiring, but it comes with its share of stress. While Kat is focused on expanding her product line and writing a new book, the shop faces unexpected - and unwelcome - changes. The introduction of new shop manager, Aubry Fisher, (from <i>Rock of Love</i> fame) is just one example.</p><p>Playing by her own rules, Kat lives a fast-paced, rebel lifestyle. Hers is a life of freedom: she sets her own schedule, picks her clients, sleeps late,and parties all night. For her shop to be a continued success, Kat will need to learn how to balance her lifestyle and her business while managing a colorful staff of renowned artists. <i>LA Ink</i> offers a rare glimpse into an LA that is seldom seen, through the eyes of a true insider.</p></td><td>Reality</td><td>1574218247</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/936/la-ink</td><td>null</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/91171), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/937))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>2010-09-15</td><td>List(tt1319636, 95781, 21649)</td><td>List(Drama, Action, Crime)</td><td>937</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/6/16180.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/6/16180.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Dark Blue</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 14, TNT)</td><td>null</td><td>2009-07-15</td><td>List(7.9)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Wednesday), 21:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Officer Carter Shaw and his team go undercover - sometimes too deep, among the criminals of modern-day Los Angeles.</p></td><td>Scripted</td><td>1618740389</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/937/dark-blue</td><td>null</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/2166114), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/938))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>List(tt0115355, 76355, 5199)</td><td>List(Drama, Crime)</td><td>938</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/354/887273.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/354/887273.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Silent Witness</td><td>List(List(GB, United Kingdom, Europe/London), 12, BBC One)</td><td>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007y6k8</td><td>1996-02-21</td><td>List(7.9)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Monday, Tuesday), 21:00)</td><td>Running</td><td><p>Expert forensic pathologists speak on behalf of the voiceless in this compelling crime drama.</p></td><td>Scripted</td><td>1633481428</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/938/silent-witness</td><td>null</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1707467), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/939))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>2019-09-12</td><td>List(tt1197649, 81578, 18481)</td><td>List(Adventure)</td><td>939</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/302/755261.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/302/755261.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Ax Men</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 53, History)</td><td>https://www.history.com/shows/ax-men</td><td>2008-03-09</td><td>List(5.8)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Thursday), 20:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>For more than a hundred years, larger than life characters, many of whom are members of logging families who go back to the time when the West was being settled, have spent their days among towering trees and powerful machines and their nights in outposts far from the comforts of civilization. <b>Ax Men</b> tells their remarkable story, detailing the history of the logging industry and how technology has transformed life for today's logger, while the struggle of man versus nature stays the same.

With the help of his Grandpa Max and \"dweeb\" cousin Gwen, Ben defeats his arch-nemesis Vilgax in the \"Secret of the Omnitrix\" movie special, leaving the planet earth safe from evil alien threats. In \"Ben 10: Alien Force\" (premiered April 2008), our hero is now fifteen years old and must once again use the Omnitrix to protect the earth from a new, sinister alien conspiracy that threatens to conquer the entire universe! This time around he has the help of not only his cousin Gwen (who is learning to master alien powers of her own), but his old nemesis Kevin Levin. Together, our trio of heroes span the globe (and galaxy!) to protect the earth from threats as they arise. Picking up immediately where \"Ben 10: Alien Force\" leaves off, \"Ben 10: Ultimate Alien\" (premiering April 2010) follows the now 16-year-old Ben as his life changes in major ways! The Omnitrix has been destroyed and Ben must now learn to master the secrets of the mysterious Ultimatrix, a new watch-like device that not only allows him to transform into a variety of alien super heroes, but also gives him the ability to activate evolved (or \"ultimate\") versions of some of his most powerful alien entities!

Course by course, the chefs will be \"chopped\" from the competition until only one winner remains. The challenge? They have seconds to plan and 30 minutes to cook an amazing course with the basket of mystery ingredients given to them moments before the clock starts ticking! And the pressure doesn't stop there. Once they've completed their dish, they've got to survive the Chopping Block where our three judges are waiting to be wowed and not shy about voicing their culinary criticisms! Our host, Ted Allen, leads this high-energy, high-pressure show that will have viewers rooting for a winner and cheering for the losers. <i>Chopped</i> is a game of passion, expertise and skill — and in the end, only one chef will survive the Chopping Block.

From the destruction wrought by the heroin kingpins in Harlem of the 1970s to today's most dangerous gang MS-13, which has spread out from the inner city to infect unexpected turf —suburban communities—gangs have a rich yet deadly history. They usually start out as a form of protection for their members and community but then grow predatory as they feed on the very people that they purport to defend.

Oxygen's hit true crime series, <i>Snapped</i>, profiles the fascinating cases of women accused of murder. Did they really do it? And, if they did, why? Whether the motivation was revenge against a cheating husband, the promise of a hefty insurance payoff, or putting an end to years of abuse, the reasons are as varied as the women themselves. From socialites to secretaries, female killers share one thing in common: at some point, they all snapped. <b>Snapped </b>is produced in conjunction with Jupiter Entertainment, the creators of <i>City Confidential</i> and <i>Dominick Dunne's Power</i>, <i>Privilege &amp; Justice</i>, and narrated by veteran news reporter Sharon Martin. Each episode of <i>Snapped</i> chronicles the life of a woman who has been charged with murder. These shocking but true stories turn common assumptions about crime and criminals upside down, and prove that even the most unlikely suspects can be capable of murder.</p></td><td>Documentary</td><td>1635947899</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/974/snapped</td><td>null</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/95649), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/975))</td><td>30</td><td>null</td><td>1968-03-14</td><td>List(tt0059968, 77871, 2719)</td><td>List(Comedy, Action, Adventure)</td><td>975</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/6/16463.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/6/16463.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Batman</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 3, ABC)</td><td>null</td><td>1966-01-12</td><td>List(7.9)</td><td>30</td><td>List(List(Thursday), 19:30)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Wealthy entrepreneur Bruce Wayne and his ward Dick Grayson lead a double life: they are actually crime fighting duo Batman and Robin.

Every night at the same hour, something inside Jason changes, leaving him almost unrecognizable - seductive, devious, borderline sociopathic.

VH1's <b>Audrina</b> will introduce the world to a never-before-seen side of Audrina - her large, outrageous, Orange County family. As she advances her acting, modeling and business career, she is juggling a prominent role in her large, tight-knit family. With her tell-it-like-it-is mom, Lynn, and chilled-out dad, Mark, at the center of this crazy bunch, Audrina is still expected to have an active presence in the lives of her three younger siblings: former wild child Casey, now married to motocross star Kyle Loza and mother of two; genial younger brother Marky, who aspires to pro motocross himself and has an annoying habit of befriending Audrina's exes; and 15-year-old sister Samantha, who is already exhibiting a rebellious streak that could put Casey and Audrina's to shame. Work-focused and family-oriented, yet still sexy and dynamic, Audrina shows a personal side of herself on VH1 that is funny, relatable and endearing to anyone who's ever had to balance the expectations of family and friends against their own hopes and dreams. From her #1 debuting album Kaleidoscope Heart, Sara Bareilles' anthemic song \"Uncharted\" is the theme music for VH1's Audrina. Other songs from \"Kaleidoscope Heart\" will also be used throughout the series as featured placements.</p></td><td>Reality</td><td>1598816416</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1028/audrina</td><td>null</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/99221), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1029))</td><td>90</td><td>null</td><td>2011-09-07</td><td>List(tt1534363, 250539, 29055)</td><td>List()</td><td>1029</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/6/16700.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/6/16700.jpg)</td><td>Spanish</td><td>Punta Escarlata</td><td>List(List(ES, Spain, Europe/Madrid), 96, Telecinco)</td><td>null</td><td>2011-07-25</td><td>List(null)</td><td>90</td><td>List(List(), 23:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Misterio, suspense y elementos característicos del thriller se suceden en esta serie que plantea en nueve episodios la resolución de un oscuro caso en un lugar lleno de secretos, vicios inconfesables y conflictos que han prevalecido a lo largo de los años.

He claims that he has been sent to New York City by Zeus to bring 100 romantically challenged couples together before being allowed to return to Mt. Olympus. His persistence eventually lands him in a mental institution. Three months later, Trevor is found to be harmless to himself and others and is released -- but under certain conditions. Placed under the care of psychiatrist and self-help author Dr. Claire McCrae, he must attend her singles group therapy sessions on a regular basis so that she can monitor his progress. Trevor returns to his rented room upstairs from the struggling Tres Equis Cantina, owned by Felix Araiza and his sister, Lita. In exchange for rent, Trevor becomes a bartender and creates an atmosphere for singles looking for lasting love. His ideas, such as half-price margarita nights and mariachi karaoke duets, could help him bring couples together and ultimately take him closer to the day that he gets to return to Mt. Olympus. No one believes Trevor's story, but everyone finds him to be quite charming. Although he possesses a great knowledge of Greek mythology, Claire finds that Trevor constantly interferes and contradicts her when it comes to her pragmatic style of helping lonely hearts find their soul mates. In true love, Claire believes it's all about friendship and mutual respect; for Trevor, heat and passion conquer all. Only time will tell who will win this battle for love.</p></td><td>Scripted</td><td>1607136957</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1091/cupid</td><td>null</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/102577), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1092))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>2013-12-28</td><td>List(tt2951788, 270814, 38490)</td><td>List(Drama, Romance, Mystery)</td><td>1092</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/6/17213.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/6/17213.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Death Comes to Pemberley</td><td>List(List(GB, United Kingdom, Europe/London), 12, BBC One)</td><td>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01mqkm5</td><td>2013-12-26</td><td>List(8.0)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Thursday, Friday, Saturday), 21:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Adaptation of PD James's bestselling homage to Pride and Prejudice.

Thanks to his smash-hit single, \"Rico Suave,\" he was living the good life with all of the fame, fortune, and women to show for it. Twenty years later, Gerardo's life is still pretty good if not just a little bit different.

However, despite Gerardo's early success, life was not always easy in the Mejia household.</p><p>Over the years, Kathy and the kids weathered the storm of success and what comes after it. With the admission of infidelities spanning a decade, Gerardo and Kathy are now trying to pick up the pieces of their marriage and reconnect with their children.</p><p>But even without a marriage to repair, Gerardo and Kathy would have their hands full.

When things go awry, they're forced to take more than a dozen hostages from all walks of life, including a wealthy and powerful businessman's daughter. Suddenly, \"Mr. Wolf\" finds himself battling the police, the hostages and members of his own team while at the same time, fighting his own personal demons from the Iraq war and from his own war at home. Will he be sharp enough to hold it all together or lose control of the situation? And will he find redemption before it's too late -- and does he even care to? On the opposite side of the perimeter is \"Horst Cali,\" the Pittsburgh Police Department Hostage Negotiator, played by Donnie Wahlberg, who must go toe-to-toe with \"Mr. Wolf.\" \"Cali\" must use his wit and negotiating skills, while managing his own personal issues, to manipulate the situation and convince Wolf to free the hostages before the FBI takes control, or worse. With time of the essence and the uncertainty of the unfolding events, both men need to remain resourceful and collected or risk losing lives. <i>The Kill Point</i> reveals how the hostage takers leverage their situation and how the negotiator tries to unravel their plans. Which man will blink? Who will outsmart the other? Who will survive?

The series also benefited greatly from the presence of two of the real-life Marines it depicts - Sgt. Eric Kocher and Cpl. Jeffrey Carisalez - who served as consultants. A third First Recon Marine, Sgt. Rudy Reyes, appears in the miniseries, portraying himself.</p></td><td>Scripted</td><td>1573752985</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1240/generation-kill</td><td>null</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/108423), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1241))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>2013-05-14</td><td>List(tt2229167, 259093, 30753)</td><td>List(Drama, Crime)</td><td>1241</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/224/561034.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/224/561034.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Golden Boy</td><td>List(List(US, United States, America/New_York), 2, CBS)</td><td>null</td><td>2013-02-26</td><td>List(7.1)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Tuesday), 22:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Drama about the meteoric rise of an ambitious cop who becomes the youngest police commissioner in the history of New York City.</p></td><td>Scripted</td><td>1578427814</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1241/golden-boy</td><td>null</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/108429), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1242))</td><td>60</td><td>null</td><td>2012-06-26</td><td>List(tt2232345, 256637, 30125)</td><td>List(Drama, Action, Crime)</td><td>1242</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/41/104210.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/41/104210.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Hit & Miss</td><td>List(List(GB, United Kingdom, Europe/London), 113, Sky Atlantic)</td><td>http://go.sky.com/tvboxsets/series/content/series/d03fc67462657310VgnVCM1000000b43150a____</td><td>2012-05-22</td><td>List(7.7)</td><td>60</td><td>List(List(Tuesday), 22:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Mia's a contract killer with a big secret - she used to be a man.

Sydney Andrews is the landlady, still beautiful at 40, and a central figure in the lives of all her tenants, especially handsome and rebellious David Breck. Sydney started an affair with David despite her turbulent history with his estranged father, Dr. Michael Mancini. Both father and son learned through experience that Sydney was not above using blackmail to control people. Another tenant, high-powered publicist Ella Simms, once considered Sydney her mentor, but their friendship was destroyed by betrayal, and Sydney threatened to evict Ella and ruin her career. Sydney also played a pivotal role in the career of Auggie Kirkpatrick. After they met at an AA meeting, she became Auggie's sponsor and encouraged his dream to become a chef. Now a successful sous chef at the trendy restaurant Coal, Auggie has been avoiding Sydney since she began drinking again. The other tenants include Lauren Yung, a medical student in desperate need of money to pay her student loans, and Jonah Miller, an aspiring filmmaker who has just proposed to his live-in girlfriend Riley Richmond, a first-grade teacher.

The Yosts' reign and reputation, once defined in the curl of a perfect wave, have been eroded by years of bad luck, addiction and hubris. But just as things are looking like they can't get worse, a stranger named John arrives – and the Yosts' banal existence is lifted into something profound, miraculous and, possibly, universal. Set in Imperial Beach, California, the last great surf-break before Tijuana, where the U.S. meets Mexico, and water meets land, John From Cincinnati tells the story of the Yosts, a family of surfers whose awesome athletic talents have seemed for generations to come with a curse attached. The gifts of 13-year-old Shaun rival those of Butchie, his addict-derelict father, and his now-ascetically-withdrawn grandfather Mitch, both of whom defined the sport in their heydays. In shaping Shaun's career, his grandmother Cissy strives to achieve a commercial and athletic success that will compensate for the frustrations and failures of her life with her husband and son. Into this world, where even simple joy has been turned into a commodity, steps a mysterious stranger named John. Soon after, things begin to happen to the Yosts, and those whose lives they touch, that test the boundaries of past and present, the mundane and the miraculous, the natural world and what lies beyond it.</p></td><td>Scripted</td><td>1607194534</td><td>https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1276/john-from-cincinnati</td><td>null</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>List(null, List(https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/110043), List(https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1277))</td><td>30</td><td>null</td><td>2014-06-11</td><td>List(tt3431720, 280957, 42039)</td><td>List(Comedy)</td><td>1277</td><td>List(https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/7/18371.jpg, https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/7/18371.jpg)</td><td>English</td><td>Jonah from Tonga</td><td>List(List(AU, Australia, Australia/Sydney), 114, ABC)</td><td>null</td><td>2014-05-07</td><td>List(null)</td><td>30</td><td>List(List(Wednesday), 21:00)</td><td>Ended</td><td><p>Banished to Tonga to live with his uncle, 14-year-old Jonah is causing more trouble than ever.

He has ambitions of stepping out of his father's shadow by seeking recognition for his own name and achieving further greatness for his house. By his side stands his beautiful wife Lucretia who will help her husband achieve his ambitions, whatever the cost. Batiatus puts all his fortunes on the man who will gain him fame and glory. That would be his best gladiator, the Celt, Gannicus, a skilled warrior who wields dual swords with deadly purpose. Those who oppose Batiatus and his future champion(s) of Capua do so at their own peril.</p><p>Purchased as an undisciplined and disheveled recruit in the first episode, Crixus the Gaul endures mockery and threats of death to become the champion after Gannicus. As Batiatus fends off repeated attempts by his professional rival Tullius to obtain Gannicus, his relationships with his father Titus and friend Solonius begin to suffer the strain of his relentless ambition. Former champion, Oenomaus, reluctantly becomes Doctore, while Syrian recruits Ashur and Dagan try to prove themselves worthy of being gladiators. Veteran gladiators Barca and Gannicus note the rising star of Crixus, as the machinations of Batiatus and Lucretia end in tragedy for several members of the household. Against all of this, the city's splendid new arena nears completion and with it the opening games that will make slaves into gods. When the arena opens, Batiatus' gladiators prevail in the contest. Gannicus again proves himself to be the champion of Capua and a god of the arena. By virtue of his win against Solonius' gladiators, he gains his freedom and Crixus becomes the new champion.</p>","Scripted",1609475466,"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/358/spartacus-gods-of-the-arena",null,90],[[null,["https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/844360"],["https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/359"]],30,null,"2016-08-22",["tt2380303",273999,33263],["Comedy"],359,["https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/2/5459.jpg","https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/2/5459.jpg"],"English","TripTank",[["US","United States","America/New_York"],23,"Comedy Central"],"http://www.cc.com/shows/triptank","2014-04-02",[7.7],30,[["Monday"],"01:00"],"Ended","<p><b>TripTank</b> showcases animated shorts so volatile that they should come with a recommended dosage.

As a child, her father nicknamed her Painkiller Jane, describing her ability to mentally push through even the most painful situations. But her strength is about to be tested. Jane is recruited by a covert government agency dedicated to containing and, if necessary, neutralizing the threat of \"Neuros\" — individuals with superhuman neurological powers. No one knows what caused the aberrations that led to their enhanced abilities, which range from from telekinesis and telepathic suggestion to induced hallucinations.

Her newfound powers make Jane even more determined to learn everything there is to know about Neuros. Seldom malicious, Neuros often can't control their powers. Consequently, they tend to leave a trail of death and destruction.

Placed under the care of psychiatrist and self-help author Dr. Claire McCrae, he must attend her singles group therapy sessions on a regular basis so that she can monitor his progress. Trevor returns to his rented room upstairs from the struggling Tres Equis Cantina, owned by Felix Araiza and his sister, Lita. In exchange for rent, Trevor becomes a bartender and creates an atmosphere for singles looking for lasting love.

No one believes Trevor's story, but everyone finds him to be quite charming.

But just as things are looking like they can't get worse, a stranger named John arrives – and the Yosts' banal existence is lifted into something profound, miraculous and, possibly, universal. Set in Imperial Beach, California, the last great surf-break before Tijuana, where the U.S. meets Mexico, and water meets land, John From Cincinnati tells the story of the Yosts, a family of surfers whose awesome athletic talents have seemed for generations to come with a curse attached. The gifts of 13-year-old Shaun rival those of Butchie, his addict-derelict father, and his now-ascetically-withdrawn grandfather Mitch, both of whom defined the sport in their heydays. In shaping Shaun's career, his grandmother Cissy strives to achieve a commercial and athletic success that will compensate for the frustrations and failures of her life with her husband and son. Into this world, where even simple joy has been turned into a commodity, steps a mysterious stranger named John.
